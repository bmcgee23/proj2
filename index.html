      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Bryant McGee. I'm a transfer student from Truman College and this is my 3rd semester here at IIT.
            Im currently enrolled in the ITM program and I plan on specializing in IT Entreprenurship and Management. Outside of school I co-operate a clothing boutique with my friend. It's a streetwear boutique based on the South Side of Chicago.
            I also have my own photography business where I photograph events, take portraits, etc. I love sports, learning about new tech, art,
            and anything creative. I want to use my ITM degree to connect connect small business with the larger global market, and I plan on implementing that with my own businesses.
        </p>
